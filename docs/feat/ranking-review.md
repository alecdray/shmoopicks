# Ranking & Review

## Notes

- Consider a dual-axis rating — one axis for objective quality (production, musicianship) and one for personal enjoyment. 
  - “it’s a masterpiece but I never play it”
- Reviews could be timestamped journal entries so users can see how their opinion evolved over time.
- Maybe reviews are multi-step:
  - Q1 — Consistency (the floor): How would you describe the album track by track?
    - Almost every track is a skip
    - More misses than hits
    - Mixed — some great, some weak
    - Mostly strong with a few weak spots
    - No skips, front to back
  - Q2 — Impact: How did this album make you feel while listening?
    - Bored or uncomfortable
    - Mostly indifferent
    - Engaged but nothing special
    - Moved — emotionally or physically
    - Completely absorbed, transported somewhere else
  - Q3 — Gut check (the multiplier): When the album ended, what was your immediate reaction?
    - Relief it was over
    - Indifferent
    - Satisfied
    - Impressed
    - I immediately restarted it
