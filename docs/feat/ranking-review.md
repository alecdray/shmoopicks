# Ranking & Review

# Notes

Avoid a plain 1–5 star system. 
Consider a dual-axis rating — one axis for objective quality (production, musicianship) and one for personal enjoyment. 
This mirrors how music lovers actually think (“it’s a masterpiece but I never play it”). 
Reviews could be timestamped journal entries so users can see how their opinion evolved over time.
