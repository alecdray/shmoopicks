# Tagging

## Notes

Users should have the ability to tag entities in the system for a more intuitive search experience.
A mood tagging system (rainy day, workout, focus, nostalgic) may work well and be intuitive.
Genres should be included, could also provide genere information/notes.

Could tie this into the Ranklist idea where each tag automatically get's it's own Ranklist and provides an easy way to view the top (3?) items.
